        <h1>Lost Cities</h1>
        <p>The game is played like this: Each player has to play a card with any of the 5 presented colors into its corresponding "expedition"
        in ascending order. When you start an expedition you subtract 20 points from you score and with each card you play you add up the point to your
            score. Each player gets to play or discard then forced to either draw from discard pile or deck. The game ends when the deck is empty.
        </p>
        <p>Do not be fooled by this game's simple design because it is you versus another player/AI. You have no analyze your opponent moves and play
        accordingly or else you do not stand the chance in the unforgiving world of Lost Cities</p>
